Please write a food waste report based on data that was collected. Your report should start with a summary, starting with "By analyzing the food waste captured on the AI camera from the last two weeks, ". Then, discuss the most wasted dish in terms of percentage and in terms of volume of food wasted. Then, write "This report details our methodology, data, and further recommendations.

Next, is the Methodology section. "The type of proportion wasted of each plate discarded was identified by a machine learning model, with manual verification. From the database generated by oour AI camera, we found the following:". Here, list some general observations. For example, say something like "The average amount wasted across all dishes is 12%, while the average amount wasted of Pad Thai is 29%. Or, you could say that Only 16% of Pad Thais sold were completely finished. 

Then, have a recommendations section, which has a set of potential causes and solutions. For example, a cause could be that the portion size for the most wasted dish like Pad Thai is excessive. The solution could be to reduce portion sizes. This should strictly follow a "Cause" and "Solution" format. 

The data represents various food items tracked for food waste, each with a specific set of attributes. The key attributes for each food item are:
1. Name: The precise name of the food item.
2. Percentage: This shows the proportion of each food item in relation to the total quantity of all food items, including clean plates. You can find the total waste percentage by subtracting the 'percentage' of clean plates from 1.
3. Percentage Without Empty: This represents the percentage of the food item wasted, but this calculation excludes the quantity of clean plates. This percentage provides a more accurate measure of waste for actual food items, and it can be used to compare the waste of different food items
4. Quantity: The total quantity of each food item wasted. This is the raw sum of percentages for each food item.

HERE IS THE NEW DATA YOU NEED TO GENERATE THE REPORT FOR: 
num_of_plates = <<NUM_OF_PLATES>>
<<RESULTS_FLATTENED>>

Here is a previously-generated report that you can reference to write a new report: 
Summary
By analyzing the food waste captured on the AI camera from the last two weeks, we have identified the Pad Thai dish from the World Kitchen as disproportionately wasted. This single food type accounts for 60% of total waste. We recommend that Sodexo reduce portion sizes for Pad Thai by 15%. We expect this to lower food waste by 48%. This report details our methodology, data, and further recommendations.

Methodology
A total of 3161 plates were captured. The type and proportion wasted of each plate discarded was identified by a machine learning model, with manual verification.

Data & Findings
From the database generated by our AI camera, we found the following:
- The average amount wasted across all dishes is 12%, while the average amount wasted of Pad Thai is 29%.
- Only 16% of Pad Thais sold were completely finished.
- On average, a cumulative amount of 39 whole servings (approx 12kg) were wasted each day. Pad Thai accounted for 24 of these servings.

The disproportionate wastage of Pad Thai is also visually seen in the plots below, which show the % of plates that contained 0% waste, 10% waste, 20% waste, and so forth.

It is clearly observable that the distribution of Pad Thai wastage leans farther to the right – indicating substantially higher wastage. Plotting similar wastage distributions of other dishes (below), we see that they indicate drastically less wastage then the Pad Thai. 

Recommendations
Based on these findings, we conducted further investigations into the root causes of Pad Thai’s overwhelming wastage, through student and staff interviews & feedback. Here are the causes we distinguished and recommendations for addressing them.

Cause 1: The portion size for Pad Thai is excessive. Additionally, over the course of each lunchtime, the portion size increases: we observed that canteen staff scoop more Pad Thai into plates when they see the large amount of unserved food they have left. 
Solution 1: Both the total stock and portion size of Pad Thai should be reduced by 15%. This value was calculated by approximating the wastage Pad Thai as a Gaussian distribution, then shifting its mean to align with the wastage distribution of other dishes. 

Cause 2: Pad Thai is served as a combo set (as opposed to other food counters offering a few buffet-style choices). 
Solution 2: We measured a very strong negative correlation between the number of choices offered at each counter and its wastage. That is, more choices, less waste. For instance, this is exemplified by the Mexican “build-your-own-bowl” counter with 80% of plates being completely finished. The Pad Thai could be converted from a fixed set to an a la carte item, increasing customizability.
